# Nth term

---

## Explaination
1. Solving
  Solving works by using some algebra that can be used to find the Nth term. The switch between quadratic and non quadratic sequences is done by checking if the difference in the numbers is changing. After that check it will call the function accordingly.
2. Making a sequence
  This is done by using a feature in python called "eval()" this will complete equations for us. So then it is a loop but i is changed for n.
